Pulling

> "git pull" is another command we can use to retrieve changes from s remote repository.

> Unlike fetch, pull actually updates our HEAD branch with whatever changes are retrieved from
  the remote.

> "Go and download data from github AND immediately update my local repo with those changes"

> git pull = git fetch                           +   get merge
             (Update the remote tracking branch    (Update my current branch with
              with latest changes from the          whatever changes are on the remote
              remote repository)                    tracking branch)

> To pull, we specify particular remote and branch we want to pull using
  "git pull <remote> <branch>".

> Just like with "git merge <branch>", it matters WHERE we run this command from.
  Whatever branch we run it from is where the change will be merged.

> "git pull origin master" would fetch the latest information from the origins master
  branch and merge those changes into our current branch.
