Fetching

> Fetching allow us to download changes from a remote repository, BUT those changes will not
  be automatically integrated into working files.

> It let you see what others have been working on, without having to merge those changes into
  your local repo.

> Think of it as "Please go and get the latest information from Github, but don't screw up
  my working directory".
