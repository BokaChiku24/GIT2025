Git Revert

> git revert is similar to the git reset in that they both "undo" changes, but they
  accomplish it in different ways.

> git rest actually moves the branch pointer backwards, eliminating commits.

> git revert instead creates a brand new commit which reverse/undoes the changes
  from a commit. Because it results in a new commit, you will be prompted to enter a
  commit message.

> git reset HEAD~2

  The branch pointer is moved back to an earlier commit, erasing the 2 later commits

> git revert <commit-hash>

  "Undoing" with revert

Purpose of Git Revert:

> If you want to reverse some commits that other people already have on their machine
  you should use revert.

> If you want to reverse commits that you have shared with other, use reset
