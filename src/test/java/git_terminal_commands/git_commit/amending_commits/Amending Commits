git commit -m "some commit"
git add forgotten file
git commit --amend

Suppose you just made a commit and then realized you forgot to include a file!
or, maybe you made a typo in the commit message that you want to correct.

Rather than making a brand new separate commit, you can "redo" the previous commit
using the --amend option
