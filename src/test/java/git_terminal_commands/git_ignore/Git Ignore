touch .gitignore
ls -a


Add the files which we don't want to add in the git and commit

> Create a file called .gitignore in the root of a repository. Inside the file,
  we can write patterns to tell Git which files 7 folders to ignore:

> .DS_Store will ignore files named .DS_Store
> folderName/ will ignore an entire directory
> .log will ignore any files with .log extension
