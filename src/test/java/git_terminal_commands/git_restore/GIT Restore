git restore <file-name>


Unmodifying Files with Restore

> Suppose you've made some changes to a file since your last commit. You've saved
  the file but then realize you definitely do NOT want those changes anymore!

> To restore the file to the contents in the HEAD, use git restore <file-name>

> NOTE: The above command is not "undoable". If you have uncommitted changes in the
        file, they will be lost!
