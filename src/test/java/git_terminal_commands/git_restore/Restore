Restore

> git restore is a brand new Git command that helps with undoing operations.

> Because it is so new, most of existing Git tutorials and books do not mention it
  but it is worth knowing!

> Recall that git checkout does a million different things, which may git users find very
  confusing.

> git restore was introduced alongside git switch as alternative to some of the users
  for checkout.
