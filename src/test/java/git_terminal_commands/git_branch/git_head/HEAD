HEAD

> We'll often come across the term HEAD in Git.

> HEAD is simply a pointer that refers to the current "Location" in your repository.
  It points to a particular branch reference

> HEAD always points to the latest commit you made on the master branch, but as we change
  the branch and perform commit then HEAD location changes.
