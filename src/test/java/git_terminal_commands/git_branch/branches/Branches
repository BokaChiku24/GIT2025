Branches

> Branches are an essential part of Git!

> Think of branches as alternative timeline for a project.

> They enable us to create separate contexts where we can try new things,
  or even work on multiple ideas in parallel.

> If we make changes on one branch, they do not impact the other branch
  (unless we merge the branch changes)
