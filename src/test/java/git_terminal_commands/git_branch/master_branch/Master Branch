The Master Branch

> In git, we are always working on a branch. The default branch name is 'Master'

> It doesn't do anything special or have fancy powers. It's just like ay other branch.

> Many people designate the master branch as their "source of truth" or the
  "official branch" for their codebase, but that is left to you to decide.

> From git's perspective, the master branch is just like any other branch. It does
  not have to hold "master copy" of your project.

Master ? Main ?

> In 2020, Github renamed the default branch from master to main.

> The default Git branch name is still master
