Merging

> Branch make it super easy to work within self-contained contexts, but often we
  want to incorporate changes from one branch into another!

> We can do using the git merging command

> We merge branches, not specific commits

> We always merge to the current HEAD branch

Merging Workflow:

> git switch <branch-name>
  git merge <merge-branch-name>

==================================================

Merging Made Easy

> Switch to or checkout the branch you want to merge the changes
  into (the receiving branch)

> Use the git merge command to merge changes from a specific branch
  into current branch
