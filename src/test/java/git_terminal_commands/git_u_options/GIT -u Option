> The -u option allows us to set the upstream of the branch we're pushing.

> You can think of this as a link connecting our local branch to a branch on Github.

  that it tracks the master branch on the origin repo.

What This Means:

> One we've set the upstream for a branch, we can use the git push shorthand which
  will push our current branch to upstream

> git push -u origin master
