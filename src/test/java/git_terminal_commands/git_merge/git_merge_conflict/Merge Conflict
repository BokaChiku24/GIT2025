Depending on the specific changes you are trying to merge, Git may not be able to automatically merge.
This results in merge conflicts, which you need to resolve manually.

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in blah.txt
Automatically merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

When we encounter a merge conflict, Git warns you in the console that it could not automatically
merge.

It also changes the content of your files to indicate
the conflicts that it wants you to resolve.


<<<<<<<<<<HEAD
I have 2 cats
I also have chickens
===========
I used to have a dog :(
>>>>>>>>>>>>bug-fix


Conflict Markers:
The content of your current HEAD(the branch you are trying to merge content into)
is displayed between the <<<<<<<<<<HEAD and ===========

The content from the branch you are trying to merge from is displayed between
the =========== and >>>>>>>>>>>> symbols.
