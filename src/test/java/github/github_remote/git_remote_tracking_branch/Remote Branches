(It not takes other branches)


Remote Branches

> When we cloned a repository, we have all data and Git history for the project at that
  moment in time. However, that does not mean it's all in my workspace!

> The Github repo has a branch called "pippies" but when I run "git branch" I don't see
  it on my machine! All I see is the master branch.

> git branch -r

How to work on other branch?

> If we use "git checkout <remote>/<branch>, but that will put you in HEAD detached mode.

> We want owr own local branch called "puppies", and I want it to be connected to "origin/puppies"
  just like my local "master" branch is connected to the "origin/master"

It's Super Easy !

> git switch <branch-name>


Run "git switch <remote-branch-name> to create a new local branch from the remote branch
of the same name.

"git switch puppies" makes me a local puppies branch AND sets it up to track the remote
branch origin/puppies.
