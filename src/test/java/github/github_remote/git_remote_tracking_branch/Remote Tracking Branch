When we clone the repository from the Github to our local machine it takes all branch
in our local system with "<remote-label>/<branch-name>".

This is a "Remote Tracking Branch". It's a reference to the state of the master branch
on the remote. We can't move this self. It is like a bookmark pointing to the last known
commit on the master branch of the origin.

"At the time you last communicated with this remotes repository,
here is where x branch was pointing."

They follow this patter "<remote>/<branch>"
1. "origin/master" reference the state of the mster branch on the remote repo named origin.
2. "upstream/logoRedesign" reference the state of the "logoRedesign" branch on the remote named
   upstream
