Cloning

> We have created our own Git repositories from scratch, but often we want to get
  a local copy of an existing repository instead.

> To do this, we can clone a remote repository hosted on Github or similar websites.
  All we need is a URL that we can tell Git to clone for use.

> Anyone can clone a repository from Github, provided repo is public.
  You do not need to be owner or collaborator to clone the repo locally to
  your machine. You just need the URL from Github.

> Pushing up your own changes to the Github repo...that's another story entirely!
  You need permission to do that!

> git clone is a standard git command
