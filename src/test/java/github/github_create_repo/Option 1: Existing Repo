If you already have an existing repo locally that you want to get on Github...
1. Create a new repo on Github
2. Connect your local repo (add a emote)
3. Push up your changes to Github


> Create Empty Github Repo !
> Tell your local repo about the Github repo
> Push from local repo to the new Github repo
