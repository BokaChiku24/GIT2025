If you haven't begun work on your local repo, you can...
1. Create a brand new repo on Github
2. Clone it down to your machine
3. Do some work locally
4. Push up your changes to Github

> No repo exist yet!
> Create a new empty repo on Github
> Clone the Github repo to your local machine
> The local repo is automatically "connected" to Github
> Push that new work to the Github!
